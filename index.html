        <h2>Nature</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
        physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
        Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural
        phenomena.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential
        qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura
        is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis , which originally related to the
        intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own
        accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the
        original notion;it began with certain core applications of the word by pre-Socratic philosophers
        (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency
        ever since.
        During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality,
        organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the
        part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions
        (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).
        However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially
        after Charles Darwin.</p>

    <p>Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can
        refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with
        inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the
        weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild
        animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human
        intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human
        interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or
        "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a
        distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been
        brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term
        "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.</p>

            <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases
                that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with
                much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with
                altitude. The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
                that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the
                surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature
                extremes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="menu">
            <h3>Weather</h3>
            <p>Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a
                convective system for redistributing heat. Ocean currents are another important factor in
                determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat
                energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences
                in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of
                heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar
                regions much colder.
                Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or
                hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce
                devastation...

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially latitude. A latitudinal band of the
                surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions,
                ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern
                extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted
                relative to its orbital plane. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the
                Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in
                its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the Northern and Southern Hemispheres experience
                opposite seasons.</p>

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known
                forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also
                has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's
                surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water
                below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of
                surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes,
                and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies
                and manufactured products.</p>

            <h3>Oceans</h3>
            <p>An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71%
                of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous
                body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half
                of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per
                thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though
                generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body
                of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean. This concept of a global ocean as
                a...</p>

            <h3>Ponds</h3>
            <p>A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or human-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A
                wide variety of human-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for
                aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to
                store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents
                in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate
                wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such
                as stream pools and tide pools.</p>

            <h3>Rivers</h3>
            <p>A river is a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another
                river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching
                another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek,
                brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names
                for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east
                England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to
                vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is
                generally...</p>

            <h3>Streams</h3>
            <p>A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks. In the United
                States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide. Streams are
                important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as
                corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream
                is called a riparian zone. Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an
                important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The study
                of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science...</p>

            <h3>Lakes</h3>
            <p class="tool">A lake (from Latin word lacus) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid
                on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain
                feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is
                considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed
                by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which
                has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers,
                though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in
                mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in
                endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes
                because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age. All lakes are temporary over
                geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing
                them.</p>
